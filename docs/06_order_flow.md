# Order Flow

Order flow:

1. User adds items to cart
2. User places order
3. Order created
4. Order items created
5. Payment updates status

Important rules:
- Order items lock after payment
- Triggers prevent illegal edits
- Status history is tracked

Orders are sensitive.
Never casually update them.
