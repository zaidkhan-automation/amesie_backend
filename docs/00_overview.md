# Backend Overview

This backend is a **FastAPI-based e-commerce system**.

Simple idea:
- User buys products
- Seller sells products
- System manages auth, orders, images, and AI logic

Nothing magical. Just structured.

Main parts:
- Auth (OTP + JWT)
- Products & Sellers
- Orders & Cart
- Images
- Redis cache
- AI / Graph system (extra brain)

Goal:
Make backend **stable, debuggable, future-proof**.
